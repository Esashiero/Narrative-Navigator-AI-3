We are currently maintaining 967 articles and 20,346 files, and you can help!\n---\n\nYour primary goal is to identify *all identifiable* named entities that contribute to understanding the narrative. Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"
