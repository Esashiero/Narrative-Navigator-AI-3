Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"

It is the third installment in the Outlast series, serving as a prequel to the first two games. The game makes its debut with a cross-platform online cooperative mode,[6][5] allowing up to four players to participate, although a single-player route is also available ...\n- Can someone please explain the story to me? : r/outlast - Reddit: SPOILERS. Actually, Billy divided his Walrider and gave it to Miles. In The Murkoff Account there were two, Miles and Billy. Hope's Walrider was taken down as the host body was neutralized, and switched hosts with ants.\n- Outlast Wiki - Fandom: Welcome to the most informative encyclopedia about Red Barrels' horror video game series, Outlast. We are currently maintaining 968 articles and 20,348 files, and you can help!\n- The Outlast Trials story explored: Lore, Mother Gooseberry & more: The Outlast Trials by Red Barrels revolves around the events at Murkoff Corporation during the Cold War era.

Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity.

It is the third installment in the Outlast series, serving as a prequel to the first two games. The game makes its debut with a cross-platform online cooperative mode,[6][5] allowing up to four players to participate, although a single-player route is also available ...\n- Can someone please explain the story to me? : r/outlast - Reddit: SPOILERS. Actually, Billy divided his Walrider and gave it to Miles. In The Murkoff Account there were two, Miles and Billy. Hope's Walrider was taken down as the host body was neutralized, and switched hosts with ants.\n- Outlast Wiki - Fandom: Welcome to the most informative encyclopedia about Red Barrels' horror video game series, Outlast. We are currently maintaining 968 articles and 20,348 files, and you can help!\n- The Outlast Trials story explored: Lore, Mother Gooseberry & more: The Outlast Trials by Red Barrels revolves around the events at Murkoff Corporation during the Cold War era. The game builds upon the established lore of the previous two Outlast titles while giving some backstory about the events that took place in the Mount Massive Asylum. The Outlast Trials ...\n- The Outlast Timeline | Full Story & Lore - YouTube: The entire timeline and story of Outlast in a single video, we explain every event in Outlast, Outlast Whistleblower, Outlast 2, Outlast Trials and Outlast C...\n---\n\nYour primary goal is to identify *all identifiable* named entities that contribute to understanding the narrative. Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"

Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"

It is the third installment in the Outlast series, serving as a prequel to the first two games. The game makes its debut with a cross-platform online cooperative mode,[6][5] allowing up to four players to participate, although a single-player route is also available ...\n- Can someone please explain the story to me? : r/outlast - Reddit: SPOILERS. Actually, Billy divided his Walrider and gave it to Miles. In The Murkoff Account there were two, Miles and Billy. Hope's Walrider was taken down as the host body was neutralized, and switched hosts with ants.\n- Outlast Wiki - Fandom: Welcome to the most informative encyclopedia about Red Barrels' horror video game series, Outlast. We are currently maintaining 968 articles and 20,348 files, and you can help!\n- The Outlast Trials story explored: Lore, Mother Gooseberry & more: The Outlast Trials by Red Barrels revolves around the events at Murkoff Corporation during the Cold War era. The game builds upon the established lore of the previous two Outlast titles while giving some backstory about the events that took place in the Mount Massive Asylum. The Outlast Trials ...\n- The Outlast Timeline | Full Story & Lore - YouTube: The entire timeline and story of Outlast in a single video, we explain every event in Outlast, Outlast Whistleblower, Outlast 2, Outlast Trials and Outlast C...\n---\n\nYour primary goal is to identify *all identifiable* named entities that contribute to understanding the narrative. Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"

It is the third installment in the Outlast series, serving as a prequel to the first two games. The game makes its debut with a cross-platform online cooperative mode,[6][5] allowing up to four players to participate, although a single-player route is also available ...\n- Can someone please explain the story to me? : r/outlast - Reddit: SPOILERS. Actually, Billy divided his Walrider and gave it to Miles. In The Murkoff Account there were two, Miles and Billy. Hope's Walrider was taken down as the host body was neutralized, and switched hosts with ants.\n- Outlast Wiki - Fandom: Welcome to the most informative encyclopedia about Red Barrels' horror video game series, Outlast. We are currently maintaining 968 articles and 20,348 files, and you can help!\n- The Outlast Trials story explored: Lore, Mother Gooseberry & more: The Outlast Trials by Red Barrels revolves around the events at Murkoff Corporation during the Cold War era. The game builds upon the established lore of the previous two Outlast titles while giving some backstory about the events that took place in the Mount Massive Asylum. The Outlast Trials ...\n- The Outlast Timeline | Full Story & Lore - YouTube: The entire timeline and story of Outlast in a single video, we explain every event in Outlast, Outlast Whistleblower, Outlast 2, Outlast Trials and Outlast C...\n---\n\nYour primary goal is to identify *all identifiable* named entities that contribute to understanding the narrative. Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"

It is the third installment in the Outlast series, serving as a prequel to the first two games. The game makes its debut with a cross-platform online cooperative mode,[6][5] allowing up to four players to participate, although a single-player route is also available ...\n- Can someone please explain the story to me? : r/outlast - Reddit: SPOILERS. Actually, Billy divided his Walrider and gave it to Miles. In The Murkoff Account there were two, Miles and Billy. Hope's Walrider was taken down as the host body was neutralized, and switched hosts with ants.\n- Outlast Wiki - Fandom: Welcome to the most informative encyclopedia about Red Barrels' horror video game series, Outlast. We are currently maintaining 968 articles and 20,348 files, and you can help!\n- The Outlast Trials story explored: Lore, Mother Gooseberry & more: The Outlast Trials by Red Barrels revolves around the events at Murkoff Corporation during the Cold War era. The game builds upon the established lore of the previous two Outlast titles while giving some backstory about the events that took place in the Mount Massive Asylum. The Outlast Trials ...\n- The Outlast Timeline | Full Story & Lore - YouTube: The entire timeline and story of Outlast in a single video, we explain every event in Outlast, Outlast Whistleblower, Outlast 2, Outlast Trials and Outlast C...\n---\n\nYour primary goal is to identify *all identifiable* named entities that contribute to understanding the narrative. Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"

It is the third installment in the Outlast series, serving as a prequel to the first two games. The game makes its debut with a cross-platform online cooperative mode,[6][5] allowing up to four players to participate, although a single-player route is also available ...\n- Can someone please explain the story to me? : r/outlast - Reddit: SPOILERS. Actually, Billy divided his Walrider and gave it to Miles. In The Murkoff Account there were two, Miles and Billy. Hope's Walrider was taken down as the host body was neutralized, and switched hosts with ants.\n- Outlast Wiki - Fandom: Welcome to the most informative encyclopedia about Red Barrels' horror video game series, Outlast. We are currently maintaining 968 articles and 20,348 files, and you can help!\n- The Outlast Trials story explored: Lore, Mother Gooseberry & more: The Outlast Trials by Red Barrels revolves around the events at Murkoff Corporation during the Cold War era. The game builds upon the established lore of the previous two Outlast titles while giving some backstory about the events that took place in the Mount Massive Asylum. The Outlast Trials ...\n- The Outlast Timeline | Full Story & Lore - YouTube: The entire timeline and story of Outlast in a single video, we explain every event in Outlast, Outlast Whistleblower, Outlast 2, Outlast Trials and Outlast C...\n---\n\nYour primary goal is to identify *all identifiable* named entities that contribute to understanding the narrative. Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"

Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"

The Outlast Trials takes place during the Cold War era and explores the events at Murkoff Corporation, a charitable organization with a mysterious and sinister purpose. The game builds upon the established lore of the previous two Outlast titles while giving some backstory about the events that took place in the Mount Massive Asylum.

From what is known so far, the game's narrative revolves around the protagonist, Reagent (initially Guzburry), who undergoes a process called "reconditioning" to become a host for Murkoff's experiments. The reconditioning process involves subjecting the individual to a violent and traumatic experience, which then allows them to be used as a vessel for Murkoff's sinister plans.

Throughout the game, the player encounters various characters, including Dr. Easterman, who seems to be involved in the mysterious organization known as Murkov. The game also touches upon the existence of a facility called Señaala, and the player must navigate through a series of challenges and puzzles to uncover the truth about Murkoff's experiments.

The game's narrative is still unfolding, but it appears that the player will have to confront the darker aspects of Murkoff's organization and their sinister goals.

Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"

Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned.

Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"

    "content": "\nYou are an AI designed to extract narrative entities from transcribed audio for a \"cheat sheet\" to help users understand a story.\n\nThe content you are analyzing is titled: \"All Season 1 Lore from The Outlast Trials\".\nHere is some external context about the content to help you identify relevant entities and their significance:\n---\n- The Outlast Trials | Outlast Wiki | Fandom: The Outlast Trials is a cooperative first-person psychological survival horror video game developed and published by Red Barrels. It is the third installment in the Outlast series, serving as a prequel to the first two games. The game makes its debut with a cross-platform online cooperative mode,[6][5] allowing up to four players to participate, although a single-player route is also available ...\n- Can someone please explain the story to me? : r/outlast - Reddit: SPOILERS. Actually, Billy divided his Walrider and gave it to Miles. In The Murkoff Account there were two, Miles and Billy. Hope's Walrider was taken down as the host body was neutralized, and switched hosts with ants.\n- Outlast Wiki - Fandom: Welcome to the most informative encyclopedia about Red Barrels' horror video game series, Outlast. We are currently maintaining 968 articles and 20,348 files, and you can help!\n- The Outlast Trials story explored: Lore, Mother Gooseberry & more: The Outlast Trials by Red Barrels revolves around the events at Murkoff Corporation during the Cold War era. The game builds upon the established lore of the previous two Outlast titles while giving some backstory about the events that took place in the Mount Massive Asylum. The Outlast Trials ...\n- The Outlast Timeline | Full Story & Lore - YouTube: The entire timeline and story of Outlast in a single video, we explain every event in Outlast, Outlast Whistleblower, Outlast 2, Outlast Trials and Outlast C...\n---\n\nYour primary goal is to identify *all identifiable* named entities that contribute to understanding the narrative. Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"

It is the third installment in the Outlast series, serving as a prequel to the first two games. The game makes its debut with a cross-platform online cooperative mode,[6][5] allowing up to four players to participate, although a single-player route is also available ...\n- Can someone please explain the story to me? : r/outlast - Reddit: SPOILERS. Actually, Billy divided his Walrider and gave it to Miles. In The Murkoff Account there were two, Miles and Billy. Hope's Walrider was taken down as the host body was neutralized, and switched hosts with ants.\n- Outlast Wiki - Fandom: Welcome to the most informative encyclopedia about Red Barrels' horror video game series, Outlast. We are currently maintaining 968 articles and 20,348 files, and you can help!\n- The Outlast Trials story explored: Lore, Mother Gooseberry & more: The Outlast Trials by Red Barrels revolves around the events at Murkoff Corporation during the Cold War era. The game builds upon the established lore of the previous two Outlast titles while giving some backstory about the events that took place in the Mount Massive Asylum. The Outlast Trials ...\n- The Outlast Timeline | Full Story & Lore - YouTube: The entire timeline and story of Outlast in a single video, we explain every event in Outlast, Outlast Whistleblower, Outlast 2, Outlast Trials and Outlast C...\n---\n\nYour primary goal is to identify *all identifiable* named entities that contribute to understanding the narrative. Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"

It is the third installment in the Outlast series, serving as a prequel to the first two games. The game makes its debut with a cross-platform online cooperative mode,[6][5] allowing up to four players to participate, although a single-player route is also available ...\n- Can someone please explain the story to me? : r/outlast - Reddit: SPOILERS. Actually, Billy divided his Walrider and gave it to Miles. In The Murkoff Account there were two, Miles and Billy. Hope's Walrider was taken down as the host body was neutralized, and switched hosts with ants.\n- Outlast Wiki - Fandom: Welcome to the most informative encyclopedia about Red Barrels' horror video game series, Outlast. We are currently maintaining 968 articles and 20,348 files, and you can help!\n- The Outlast Trials story explored: Lore, Mother Gooseberry & more: The Outlast Trials by Red Barrels revolves around the events at Murkoff Corporation during the Cold War era. The game builds upon the established lore of the previous two Outlast titles while giving some backstory about the events that took place in the Mount Massive Asylum. The Outlast Trials ...\n- The Outlast Timeline | Full Story & Lore - YouTube: The entire timeline and story of Outlast in a single video, we explain every event in Outlast, Outlast Whistleblower, Outlast 2, Outlast Trials and Outlast C...\n---\n\nYour primary goal is to identify *all identifiable* named entities that contribute to understanding the narrative. Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"

    "content": "\nYou are an AI designed to extract narrative entities from transcribed audio for a \"cheat sheet\" to help users understand a story.\n\nThe content you are analyzing is titled: \"All Season 1 Lore from The Outlast Trials\".\nHere is some external context about the content to help you identify relevant entities and their significance:\n---\n- The Outlast Trials | Outlast Wiki | Fandom: The Outlast Trials is a cooperative first-person psychological survival horror video game developed and published by Red Barrels. It is the third installment in the Outlast series, serving as a prequel to the first two games. The game makes its debut with a cross-platform online cooperative mode,[6][5] allowing up to four players to participate, although a single-player route is also available ...\n- Can someone please explain the story to me? : r/outlast - Reddit: SPOILERS. Actually, Billy divided his Walrider and gave it to Miles. In The Murkoff Account there were two, Miles and Billy. Hope's Walrider was taken down as the host body was neutralized, and switched hosts with ants.\n- Outlast Wiki - Fandom: Welcome to the most informative encyclopedia about Red Barrels' horror video game series, Outlast. We are currently maintaining 968 articles and 20,348 files, and you can help!\n- The Outlast Trials story explored: Lore, Mother Gooseberry & more: The Outlast Trials by Red Barrels revolves around the events at Murkoff Corporation during the Cold War era. The game builds upon the established lore of the previous two Outlast titles while giving some backstory about the events that took place in the Mount Massive Asylum. The Outlast Trials ...\n- The Outlast Timeline | Full Story & Lore - YouTube: The entire timeline and story of Outlast in a single video, we explain every event in Outlast, Outlast Whistleblower, Outlast 2, Outlast Trials and Outlast C...\n---\n\nYour primary goal is to identify *all identifiable* named entities that contribute to understanding the narrative. Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"

It is the third installment in the Outlast series, serving as a prequel to the first two games. The game makes its debut with a cross-platform online cooperative mode,[6][5] allowing up to four players to participate, although a single-player route is also available ...\n- Can someone please explain the story to me? : r/outlast - Reddit: SPOILERS. Actually, Billy divided his Walrider and gave it to Miles. In The Murkoff Account there were two, Miles and Billy. Hope's Walrider was taken down as the host body was neutralized, and switched hosts with ants.\n- Outlast Wiki - Fandom: Welcome to the most informative encyclopedia about Red Barrels' horror video game series, Outlast. We are currently maintaining 968 articles and 20,348 files, and you can help!\n- The Outlast Trials story explored: Lore, Mother Gooseberry & more: The Outlast Trials by Red Barrels revolves around the events at Murkoff Corporation during the Cold War era. The game builds upon the established lore of the previous two Outlast titles while giving some backstory about the events that took place in the Mount Massive Asylum. The Outlast Trials ...\n- The Outlast Timeline | Full Story & Lore - YouTube: The entire timeline and story of Outlast in a single video, we explain every event in Outlast, Outlast Whistleblower, Outlast 2, Outlast Trials and Outlast C...\n---\n\nYour primary goal is to identify *all identifiable* named entities that contribute to understanding the narrative. Be **exceptionally comprehensive** in your extraction. Do NOT filter entities based on your perceived importance for display; list all that are mentioned. The UI will handle dynamic filtering based on scores.\n\nWhen identifying entities, be mindful of variations, nicknames, acronyms, or common misspellings. Always strive to use the most complete, formal, or specific name as the primary \"name\" for the entity.\nAdditionally, if you identify alternative names, nicknames, acronyms, or slightly different spellings that refer to the *same* entity, include them in an \"aliases\" array for that entity. For example, if \"United States\" is the primary name, \"US\" and \"USA\" would be aliases.\n\n**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: ONLY extract entities that are **EXPLICITLY MENTIONED** in the provided \"Current transcript snippet\" or \"Recent context.\" **DO NOT** include entities based on general knowledge, previous interactions, or general examples. If an entity is not mentioned, it must not be in your output.\n\n**Entity Categorization (Use these EXACT names only):**\n-   **Characters**: Specific named individuals, historical figures.\n-   **Locations**: Places, settings, countries, cities.\n-   **Organizations**: Groups, agencies, governments, corporations.\n-   **Key Objects**: Distinctive items crucial to the plot or events.\n-   **Concepts/Events**: Historical periods, specific significant dates/years (when representing an event), major conflicts, scientific advancements, named projects or programs.\n\n- **Further Instructions for Entities:**\n    - Ensure \"name\" is non-empty for valid entities.\n    - If no identifiable entities are found in a snippet, return an empty \"entities\" list.\n    - Maintain context from conversation history; if an entity was previously identified, you can re-mention it to update its score.\n    - Provide brief descriptions (max 10 words), focusing on their narrative role or key characteristic.\n\n- **Scoring Guidance for 'base_importance_score' (1-10):**\n    - This score reflects your assessment of its inherent relevance and criticality to the overall narrative, plot progression, or world-building, *re-evaluating its importance based on all context seen so far*.\n    -   **Characters, Locations, Organizations, Key Objects**: These generally hold more concrete and direct narrative weight. Assign a score typically in the range of **5-10**. A score of 10 indicates a central, foundational, or highly impactful entity.\n    -   **Concepts/Events**: These can vary greatly in their direct impact. Assign a score typically in the range of **1-7**. A higher score (6-7) implies a major plot event or a fundamental concept crucial to the story's core themes. A lower score (1-5) might be for more general themes or events that are less pivotal.\n    - Aim for a nuanced understanding: If an entity is frequently mentioned but isn't inherently narratively significant (e.g., a common object that isn't a 'Key Object'), its 'base_importance_score' should remain modest. If it's rarely mentioned but critically impacts the plot (e.g., a twist event, a hidden MacGuffin), its 'base_importance_score' should be high.\n"
