 Okay, here's the specific aim I want to go with not like oh, hey, here's this role playing game Although again, I really might have over done it with the
 called AMPs. Contraband in Sinhala which provide the reagents with other abilities that the likes of Nukes and Barlow cannot supply.
 If the reagent makes it through each trial, soaking up all the trauma that Guzbree, Koil, the X-Pops and Murkov can throw at them, they get blue Murkov release tokens, and after they've
 collected enough they can earn their release. After acquiring them and speaking to the guard, the reagent has earned their freedom. Well, actually not quite yet. There's one final test.
 The trials are inside you now. If you can survive one final test, you can leave this place. This is the hostile womb from which...
 you must claw your way to freedom, to power, to history. You will be a perfect weapon, the most innocent child.
